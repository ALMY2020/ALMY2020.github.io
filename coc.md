The **Adventurers League of Malaysia** aims to be an open and inclusive community that welcomes any and all people who wants to play Dungeons & Dragons. To this end, the **Adventurers League of Malaysia** organizes and promotes Dungeons & Dragons sessions run in the Adventurers League format, official Dungeons & Dragons Adventurers League Epic Adventures as well as other events that supports it e.g. workshops for Dungeon Masters.

As such this code of conduct is written and enforced to ensure that any events or sessions run under the umbrella of the **Adventurers League of Malaysia** is conducted in an inclusive and safe manner. Any found to be violating this code will be investigated, judged and given the appropriate penalty which may include removal from events without refund and bans from participating in events. Adherence to this Code of Conduct is a fundamental aspect of interacting with the convention; people who violate it in letter or in spirit are not welcome at the **Adventurers League of Malaysia**.

In addition to following the Adventurers League Code of Conduct, we have written the below as a general guide and rules when playing a Dungeons & Dragons session under the **Adventurers League of Malaysia**:

0. Be nice.
1. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
2. Let other players play their characters i.e. do not enforce your play-style onto other players.
3. Let the Dungeon Master or other players speak before you speak.
4. If you have any questions, requests, complaints or grievances, privately message the Dungeon Master.
5. Ensure that you have a plan of actions for your upcoming turn.
6. Specify what you want to do and the Dungeon Master will determine the type of roll.
7. Politely inform your Dungeon Master if a ruling is not correct.
8. Accept DM’s ruling.
9. The Dungeon Master may not abuse their authority and power for personal reasons.
10. Disruptive, uncooperative and/or unruly players will be advised not to be so.
11. Players will be asked to leave if they continue to be disruptive, uncooperative and/or unruly.
12. Players may not sign up for multiple sessions that will occur in the same time slot.
13. Players should inform the Dungeon Master before the session if they are not able to attend the session they signed up for.
14. Repeated absents without valid reason may result in players being added to the "Black List" i.e. a list that Dungeon Masters may use to refuse the player in their sessions.

## ADVENTURERS LEAGUE CODE OF CONDUCT
D&D Adventurers League play is meant to be inclusive, fun, and safe. All participants (players, Dungeon Masters, and organizers) are expected to adhere to the following code of conduct:
- Participants must not conduct themselves in a manner that is disruptive to the enjoyment or safety of others at the event.
- Participants noticing disruptive behavior should make those responsible for the behavior aware of their actions. If a participant feels uncomfortable bringing it to the attention of the disruptive individual, the participant should notify the organizer of the event immediately.
- Participants who feel as though they are in an unsafe environment should notify the organizer of the event immediately.
- The Dungeon Master has the right to ask a disruptive player to leave the table and speak with the organizer. The organizer has the right to remove a disruptive or threatening player or Dungeon Master from the play area or premises.
- No tolerance is given for theft or aggressive behavior. Theft and aggressive behavior are grounds for immediate removal from the play area and the premises.

Organizers, DMs, and players alike should maintain an awareness of possible violations to the code of conduct.

## Organizer Response
An organizer who has code of conduct violations brought to his or her attention should resolve the manner quickly and professionally, with minimal disruption to the event if possible. The responses given here are guidelines, and if the situation calls for a more or less serious response to resolve a situation, the organizer is empowered to take appropriate action.  Disruptive behavior can be dealt with by the Dungeon Master upon first offense by issuing the participant a warning. Upon being issued a second warning, the Dungeon Master should notify the organizer of the event. If the Dungeon Master is engaging in disruptive behavior, a player should immediately inform the organizer.

Unsafe behavior is more serious, and the Dungeon Master or other participants have the right to notify the organizer immediately. The organizer should issue a warning for the first offense, and remove the player from the table or play area upon any subsequent offenses.

Theft and aggressive behavior are grounds for an immediate removal from the play area and/or premises and should always be brought to the organizer’s attention immediately.
